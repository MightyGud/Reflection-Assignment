        <p>Design ideas</p>
        <p>My ideas for the design itself are guided by 3 main values: immersive, playful, and curiosity. I wanted users to be drawn into this immersive feeling of a landscape where they can explore and experience the UI without getting the feeling of boredom, and be more persuaded. That's how I came up with a cosmic landscape where you can explore and interact with the planets. Each planet represents a note and plays when the users click it. And the playfulness will be generated by dragging the planets by using Math.random(). When you drag one planet, it generates a random note. The curiosity was encouraged by hiding the interactive elements within the visual space. And it can be done by moving or dragging.
