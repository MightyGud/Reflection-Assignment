          <p id="Concept-title">Design ideas</p>
          <p>
            My ideas for the design itself are guided by 3 main values:
            immersive, playful, and curiosity. I wanted users to be drawn into
            this immersive feeling of a landscape where they can explore and
            experience the UI without getting the feeling of boredom, and be
            more persuaded. That's how I came up with a cosmic landscape where
            you can explore and interact with the planets. Each planet
            represents a note and plays when the users click it. And the
            playfulness will be generated by dragging the planets by using
            Math.random(). When you drag one planet, it generates a random note.
            The curiosity was encouraged by hiding the interactive elements
            within the visual space. And it can be done by moving or dragging.

          <p>Feedback, Information, and Learnability.</p>
          <p>
            For the feedback is when a user drags or clicks on one of the chosen
            planets, when clicked, a tone will play from the planet, and when
            held, the earth stops and follows the cursor hand, while moving it
            will generate random notes and only stop when released. One of the
            feedback that I want is that when you hover around the planet, the
            planet will zoom out by itself, which also shows that you can
            interact with the planet and explore what each planet has.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Information of the design is to avoid as much text as possible,
            and more interaction and exploration. The system itself is like a
            map that is meant to direct the users to follow the flow of the
            design. This concept of mapping styles helps users feel like they
            are playing instead of just looking around with nothing else to do.
            And by interaction with the planet, this allows the design to be
            more interesting to the users, so that they can use these planets to
            generate notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learnability will come naturally through play. I want to aim for no
            instructions. Instead of the instructions, this will be more of a
            user's experiment, by receiving instant feedback, and understanding
            how the movement relates to the audio. Each action builds a familiar
            vibe and rewarding rather than instruction.

          <p>Significant Changes Since the Milestone</p>
          <p>
            Before the miles stone there is only 3 planets, in the solar system:
            Mercury, Venus and Earth. But during those time i have to fix the
            javascript and css. The sound itself felt chaotic and disconnected.
            Some planet cannot be interacted because they got overlay. Not only
            that during the presentation the response seem make the users more
            confuse and harder to use. After the milestone, the whole solar
            system is filled with planets. The sound of the feedback is more
            clearer, the pitch of Math.random() help the sound generate more
            controllable. I refined the rotation of the planets, so that it more
            easier to be interact by the users since some planet is more faster
            than the other that make the interaction more harder to use.

          <p>Navigation the Production Timeline.</p>
          <p>
            My first Production Timline changed during the work. I Begin my
            visual sketches and layout tests in Week 7, After that i spent most
            of my week is to interact with the sounds and fixing SoundUI.js.
            During that time unexpected issues happened such as the sound not
            working and the layers is all messed up. It also have so many bug
            that make the website unusable. The debugging process is the most
            annoying part of the problem. This actually took me 3 weeks to
            finish. During week 8-9, I have a Mental Breakdown. During that
            time, I couldn’t concentrate, and it took me a long time to help
            with my depression. It's not a great experience at all. By the
            middle of week 10, I focused on debugging. And at week 12, I will
            polish the presentation and deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This actually taught me many thing about the importance of
            understanding and searching for what is importance for my learning
            experiences. Sometimes, solving technical problems can lead a
            breakthrough of knowledge. And the most important of all is to
            understanding your health status and what situation you put yourself
            into so that you can control it.

          <p>Design Aspect I’m Most Proud Of</p>
          <p>
            The design that I am proud of is the sound, the motion of the
            planets. When merged together, it makes the interaction smoother.
            Not only that it make the who experience more alive and the
            combination of the visual makes the audio more dynamic. What i am
            more happy about is the sound and the planets connect together.
            Especially when that is the most annoying thing to do. It’s not only
            making the UI more mindful and curious.

          <p>Design Aspect I Found Most Challenging</p>
          <p>
            The Biggest Challenge was to ensure the clarity of the websites.
            It's really hard to make the users understand the website; early
            testers didn’t realise planets were interactive. Thanks to the hover
            effect that I added for each planet. This makes the interaction more
            understandable and easier to navigate around the UI. What I mostly
            found more challenging is when you have to debug the whole
            JavaScript code; most of the coding section is not that easy, and
            it’s really hard to follow up. I also struggle to keep the audio
            consistent. A sound start to generate the previous planet by
            clicking on it, and it took 3 clicks or more to generate the sound
            designated to the planet. So I had to experiment with the tone
            ranges and the timing.

          <p>7. If I Have More Time.</p>
          <p>
            If I have more time, I want to expand the depth of the interaction.
            Such as adding the volume to the UI, making the UI more textured,
            maybe adding a spaceship control-style panel to make the site feel
            like an exploration. Not only that, if i would have added a switch
            to change the sound. I want to add some music that can depend on the
            Planet's aesthetics.

          <p>8. Closing Reflection.</p>
          <p>
            Through this project, I learned that interaction can be used as a
            way to describe feelings. My UI embodies the ideas of play, sound,
            and curiosity that can replace text using instruction. Not only
            that, but it also taught me my own limitations in my knowledge of
            using complex technical skills. Understanding my weak points and
            using them as motivation it teach me to understand the problems and
            learning how to solve it in my own way.
